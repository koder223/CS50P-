# WRITING IN ALL CAPS IS LIKE YELLING.
# Best to use your “indoor voice” sometimes, writing entirely in lowercase.
# In a file called indoorvoice.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and
# then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged.
# You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly,
# as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.

# INDOOR VOICE

# Taking the input
indoor_voice = input("")
# Converting any upper case letter(s) into lower case using variablename.lower()
print(indoor_voice.lower())
